With the Django REST system, we can construct a simple machine learning application that forecasts the species of a sample flower based on measurements of its characteristics i.e. the dimensions of the sepal and petal, length and width. Here we'd use the same Django application and make some adjustments as appropriate. We will use Postgres as our database for this development, since Postgres is best suited for building production. Django comes bundled with a fantastic dashboard from the admin. We can register users for our application with the admin dashboard, which can then communicate with our machine learning application to make predictions. This will then serve the function of our backend and admin duties for our Django application.
